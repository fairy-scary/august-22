/* isPrime
 Define a function isPrime(number) that returns 
 true if number is prime. Otherwise, false. 
 A number is prime if it is 
 only divisible by 1 and itself.
 Better definition: a prime number has exactly two distinct 
 factors, 1 and itself, or that a prime is a whole number 
 greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
