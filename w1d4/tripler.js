/*Tripler
Write a function tripler(nums) that takes in an array as an arg. 
The function should return a new array containing three times every number of the original array.*/

/* 1. Understand the problem ...

 - array is only arg
 - multiply each element of array * 3
 - store each newly computed element in a new array
 - return completed new array

*/

/* 2. Make a plan ...

 - start with empty array in holding variable
 - Use a for loop to iterate the array passed as the arg
 - access array element at i on each loop
 - 

*/

// Carry out the plan ...



intersect arrays in dl

console.log(tripler([2, 7, 4])); // [ 6, 21, 12 ]
console.log(tripler([-5, 10, 0, 11])); // [ -15, 30, 0, 33 ]
